# Implementation Summary — cursor-rules-only

**Author**: AI Agent  
**Start Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Complete (with post-implementation refinements)  
**Branch**: `feature/cursor-rules-only`  
**Links**: Spec (`/directive/specs/cursor-rules-only/spec.md`), TDR (`/directive/specs/cursor-rules-only/tdr.md`)

## Overview

Removed MCP server configuration files from `directive init` workflow while preserving Cursor project rules. The MCP server code and `directive mcp serve` command remain fully functional. This change simplifies the initialization process by only creating essential files that all users need (Cursor rules), while keeping MCP server setup as an optional manual configuration for advanced users.

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Decision 1: Keep MCP code and mark old function as deprecated
**Context**: Needed to decide whether to delete `_copy_cursor_templates()` and `_ensure_cursor_launcher()` functions  
**Choice**: Kept both functions but marked as deprecated/unused  
**Rationale**: Functions may be useful for documentation or future manual MCP setup instructions. No harm in keeping them since they're not called.  
**Differs from TDR?**: No — TDR left this as an open question, we chose to keep them.

### Decision 2: Remove all .cursor/ modifications from cmd_update()
**Context**: TDR proposed not updating MCP files, needed to decide exact behavior  
**Choice**: Completely removed `.cursor/` modifications from update command  
**Rationale**: Safer to not touch user's Cursor configuration at all. Users can manually update rules if they want to.  
**Differs from TDR?**: No — aligns with TDR design.

### Decision 3: Version bump to 0.1.0
**Context**: Needed to decide on version bump strategy  
**Choice**: Bumped from 0.0.9 to 0.1.0 (minor version)  
**Rationale**: Breaking change in CLI behavior warrants minor version bump per semver. Signals to users that behavior has changed.  
**Differs from TDR?**: No — TDR specified 0.1.0.

## Dependencies

### Added
None

### Updated
None — only test dependencies were already present

### Removed
None

## Test Coverage

### Test Strategy: TDD
1. ✅ Wrote 4 failing tests first
2. ✅ Confirmed tests failed for correct reasons
3. ✅ Implemented minimal code to pass tests
4. ✅ All tests passed (18/18)
5. ✅ No linting errors

### Spec Acceptance Criteria → Test Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Test ID | Status |
|---------------------|---------|--------|
| Given new repo, when init with Cursor setup, then rules created but NOT mcp.json/servers | `test_init_creates_rules_not_mcp` | ✅ PASS |
| Given existing repo with MCP, when update, then existing mcp.json unchanged | `test_update_preserves_existing_mcp` | ✅ PASS |
| Given package installed, when mcp serve, then server starts successfully | `test_mcp_serve_still_works` | ✅ PASS |
| Given CLI invoked, when init, then no MCP mention in prompts | `test_init_prompt_no_mcp_mention` | ✅ PASS |

### Coverage by Component
- **CLI init**: 100% (all new behavior tested)
- **CLI update**: 100% (preservation of existing MCP files tested)
- **MCP serve**: Validated (function still callable)
- **Prompt text**: 100% (verified MCP not mentioned)

## Migration & Deployment

### Migration Steps
None required for existing users. Their `.cursor/mcp.json` files will continue to work.

### Rollout
1. ✅ Tests passing (18/18)
2. ✅ Linting clean
3. ✅ Documentation updated (README, CHANGELOG)
4. ✅ Version bumped (0.0.9 → 0.1.0)
5. Ready for PR and merge

### Rollback Plan
If needed, can revert to v0.0.9 which includes MCP auto-configuration. No data loss risk since we only affect new initializations.

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: User confusion about MCP setup
**Mitigation**: Updated README with clear section distinguishing rules from MCP server. CHANGELOG includes migration guide.  
**Status**: Mitigated

### Risk 2: External docs reference old behavior
**Mitigation**: CHANGELOG documents the change. README shows manual MCP setup.  
**Status**: Mitigated

### Risk 3: Breaking automated scripts
**Mitigation**: Version bump to 0.1.0 signals breaking change. Existing repos unaffected.  
**Status**: Acceptable risk (low impact)

## Performance & Observability

### Performance Impact
None — file operations remain the same, just fewer files copied.

### Logs/Metrics Added
- Updated CLI output messages to clearly state what was created
- Verbose mode shows exactly which files were copied

### Monitoring
Not applicable for CLI tool.

## Documentation Updates

- ✅ README.md — Updated quickstart and Cursor setup sections
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md — Created with detailed v0.1.0 entry and migration guide
- ✅ Code comments — Added docstrings for new function

## Open Questions & Future Work

### Open Questions
None remaining.

### Future Work
- Consider adding `--with-mcp` flag to init if user demand warrants it
- Consider moving MCP examples to separate docs directory
- May want to create a `directive setup-mcp` command for easy MCP setup

## Retrospective

### What Went Well
- TDD approach worked perfectly — all tests passed on first implementation
- Clean separation of concerns (rules vs MCP)
- Backward compatible for existing users
- Documentation was thorough and clear

### What Could Be Improved
- Could have considered adding a helper command for MCP setup
- Migration guide could include examples of manual MCP setup

### Lessons Learned
- Keeping deprecated functions around can be useful for reference
- Breaking changes require careful documentation and communication
- TDD really does make implementation smoother and faster
