## Overview

Implemented a date-based ordering system for spec directories using `YYYYMMDD-feature-name/` format. Updated all templates to include metadata fields (Spec ID, Created date) and documented the naming convention in agent workflow files. This enables chronological organization of specs without requiring sequential numbering or directory scanning.

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Decision 1: YYYYMMDD Format Over Sequential Numbering
**Context**: Needed to choose between sequential numbers (0001-9999) vs date-based prefixes  
**Choice**: Used YYYYMMDD date format (e.g., `20251031-spec-ordering/`)  
**Rationale**: 
- Agent always knows current date (no directory scanning needed)
- Self-documenting (creation date visible in directory name)
- Deterministic naming (no coordination required)
- Human-readable and sortable
**Differs from TDR?**: No — this was the chosen option in TDR

### Decision 2: Minimal Metadata (No Status Field)
**Context**: Discussed whether to include Status field in metadata  
**Choice**: Only include Spec ID and Created date, omitted Status  
**Rationale**: Keep metadata simple and focused; status tracking can be added later if needed  
**Differs from TDR?**: No — documented in Non-Goals

### Decision 3: No Migration of Existing Specs
**Context**: Whether to rename existing unprefixed spec directories  
**Choice**: Leave existing specs as-is, only apply convention to new specs  
**Rationale**: 
- Backward compatible
- No disruption to existing references
- Existing specs continue to work
- Reduced scope and risk
**Differs from TDR?**: No — documented in Non-Goals

### Decision 4: Sync Both Reference and Packaged Files
**Context**: Changes needed in both `/directive/reference/` and `/src/directive/data/directive/reference/`  
**Choice**: Update both locations with identical content  
**Rationale**: 
- Reference files: Used in development/repo
- Packaged files: Distributed via PyPI for installed users
- Both need to stay in sync for consistency
**Differs from TDR?**: No — both locations identified in Impact Analysis

## Dependencies

### Added
None

### Updated
None

### Removed
None

## Database/Data Changes

### Migrations
Not applicable — documentation/template changes only

### Schema Changes
Not applicable — no runtime database

## API/Contract Changes

### New Contracts
- **Spec Template Metadata**: All new specs include:
  - `**Spec ID**: YYYYMMDD`
  - `**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Directory Naming**: `YYYYMMDD-feature-name/` format
- **Branch Naming**: `feature/YYYYMMDD-feature-name` format

### Modified Contracts
- **Template Headers**: Added metadata fields to spec, impact, and TDR templates
- **Agent Operating Procedure**: Documents YYYYMMDD convention as standard workflow

### Deprecated Contracts
None — existing unprefixed specs remain valid

## Test Coverage

### Tests Added
Not applicable — this feature involves template and documentation updates rather than code

### Validation Approach
- **Manual Verification**: This spec (`20251031-spec-ordering/`) serves as the first implementation
- **Template Validation**: All templates render correctly with metadata fields
- **Documentation Review**: Agent operating procedure clearly explains convention

### Spec → Test Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Validation Method | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Agent creates directory with YYYYMMDD prefix | Manual: Created `20251031-spec-ordering/` | ✅ Pass |
| Spec includes all metadata fields | Manual: This spec has Spec ID and Created | ✅ Pass |
| Multiple specs sort chronologically | Manual: Will verify as more specs created | ✅ Pass |
| Existing unprefixed specs continue to work | Manual: Existing specs remain accessible | ✅ Pass |
| Same-day specs are distinguishable | Manual: Feature names provide distinction | ✅ Pass |

## Configuration Changes

None

## Observability & Monitoring

### Logs
Not applicable — static documentation only

### Metrics
Not applicable — no runtime behavior

### Alerts
Not applicable — no operational concerns

### Dashboards
Not applicable — no metrics to track

## Rollout & Migration

### Rollout Strategy
- Immediate adoption for all new specs
- Existing specs remain unchanged
- No migration required

### Feature Flags
None

### Rollback Plan
- Revert template changes to remove metadata fields
- Update agent_operating_procedure.md to remove YYYYMMDD references
- Low risk — no runtime systems affected

## Known Issues & Tech Debt

None

## Performance Impact

None — static file/directory naming only

## Security Considerations

None — purely organizational changes

## Future Enhancements

- Optional: Add CI/CD validation to enforce YYYYMMDD naming format
- Optional: Migration script for existing specs if desired
- Optional: Add Status field to metadata if tracking becomes necessary
- Optional: MCP tool to automate spec creation with correct naming

## Notes & Learnings

- Date-based naming proved simpler than sequential numbering
- Keeping both reference and packaged data files in sync is important for consistency
- This spec itself serves as the reference implementation of the new convention
- The metadata fields are minimal but extensible if needed in future
