Follow Directive AOP gates. Do not write code until these are produced and approved:
1) Spec → `/directive/specs/<feature>/spec.md`
2) Impact Analysis → `/directive/specs/<feature>/impact.md`
3) TDR (high‑level, decisive about interfaces) → `/directive/specs/<feature>/tdr.md`

When implementing post‑approval, operate strictly with TDD (failing test → minimal impl → refactor).
