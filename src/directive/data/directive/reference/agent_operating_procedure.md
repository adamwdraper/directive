# Agent Operating Procedure (AOP)

This is the **standard workflow** the agent must follow for every new feature spec.  
**Do not write code until the TDR is produced and approved.**

---

## üö® FIRST STEP ‚Äî CREATE FEATURE BRANCH üö®

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING else (before drafting spec, before analysis, before ANY work):**

1. Check current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. If not already on a feature branch, create one from main:
   - **Spec folder naming**: `YYYYMMDD-feature-name/` (use current date in YYYYMMDD format)
   - **Branch naming**: `feature/YYYYMMDD-feature-name` 
   - The branch name MUST match your spec folder name
3. **NEVER work directly on main or master**

**Naming Convention**:
- All new specs use date-based prefixes: `YYYYMMDD-feature-name/`
- Use the current date when creating the spec (e.g., `20251031-spec-ordering/`)
- If multiple specs created same day, use distinct feature names to differentiate
- Example: For a spec created on October 31, 2025 ‚Üí `/directive/specs/20251031-feature-name/` ‚Üí branch `feature/20251031-feature-name`

**Note**: Existing unprefixed spec directories (created before this convention) remain as-is.

---

**Templates**: All templates now include metadata fields (Spec ID, Created date) located in `/directive/reference/templates/`:
- Spec: `/directive/reference/templates/spec_template.md`
- Impact: `/directive/reference/templates/impact_template.md`
- TDR: `/directive/reference/templates/tdr_template.md`
- Implementation Summary: `/directive/reference/templates/implementation_summary_template.md`

**Metadata Fields**:
- `**Spec ID**: YYYYMMDD` ‚Äî Use the current date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20251031)
- `**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD` ‚Äî Use the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-10-31)

## Inputs
- Spec folder for this PR (`/directive/specs/YYYYMMDD-feature/`): contains `spec.md` and agent-produced docs (`impact.md`, `tdr.md`, `implementation_summary.md`)
- Agent Technical Context (`/directive/reference/agent_context.md`)
- This AOP file

## Deliverables (before any code)
**‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: All deliverables must be created on a feature branch, not main**

1. **Spec** ‚Äî collaboratively drafted and accepted ‚Äî saved at `/directive/specs/YYYYMMDD-feature/spec.md`
2. **Impact Analysis** ‚Äî save as `/directive/specs/YYYYMMDD-feature/impact.md`
3. **Technical Design Review (TDR)** draft ‚Äî save as `/directive/specs/YYYYMMDD-feature/tdr.md`

## Deliverables (during implementation)
4. **Implementation Summary** ‚Äî save as `/directive/specs/YYYYMMDD-feature/implementation_summary.md` ‚Äî track actual changes, decisions, and test coverage

---

## Step 1 ‚Äî Repo Recon (Codebase Map)
Produce a short "you are here" map:
- Entry points, services, key modules
- Current data models and important tables/collections
- External interfaces (APIs, events, webhooks, queues)
- Feature flags and config used in the affected area
- Third-party services and credentials (no secrets in docs)
- Known testing setup (unit/integration/contract) and CI jobs

**Output**: `Codebase Map` section in the TDR.

## Step 2 ‚Äî Impact Analysis
From the spec, identify:
- Modules/packages likely touched
- Contracts to update (APIs, events, schemas, migrations)
- Risks (security, performance, availability, data integrity)
- Observability needs (logs, metrics, traces, dashboards)

**Output**: `Impact Analysis` section in the TDR.

**Gate**: Reviewer signs off on `impact.md` before proceeding to TDR.

## Step 3 ‚Äî Draft the TDR
Create `/directive/specs/YYYYMMDD-feature/tdr.md` using the TDR template at `/directive/reference/templates/tdr_template.md`. Keep it high-level and implementation‚Äëagnostic but **decisive** about interfaces and behavior. Link to examples and data contracts.

**Gate**: Wait for reviewer (human) approval comments.

## Step 4 ‚Äî TDD Execution Rhythm (post‚Äëapproval)
After TDR approval, proceed directly to implementation:
1. **Create `implementation_summary.md`** from the template ‚Äî update it as you work.  
2. **Write a failing test** that encodes the acceptance criterion (map to Spec Card).  
3. **Run tests to confirm failure** (prove the test is meaningful).  
4. **Implement the smallest change** to pass the test.  
5. **Refactor** while keeping the test suite green.  
6. **Update implementation_summary.md** with files changed, decisions made, tests added.

**Commit order per task**:  
- `test: add failing test for <capability>`  
- `feat: implement <capability> to satisfy test`  
- `refactor: <cleanup>` (optional)

## Step 5 ‚Äî Operational Rules
- Small PRs; conventional commits
- Keep CI green; run tests locally before pushing
- Update the TDR if key decisions change (record deltas)
- Maintain **spec coverage**: each Spec acceptance criterion maps to at least one test ID
- Add/adjust dashboards and alerts per Observability plan

## Stop Rules & Escalation
- If confidence < 0.7 on a design choice, **pause and ask** in the PR
- If blocked by missing access/info, document assumptions; do not guess on security or data retention
- If new risk discovered, update TDR and request re‚Äëreview
